# Petbook

## A social media platform dedicated pet lovers. It give users the ability to create a porfile that includes a short description of themselves and their pets. User are able to post as much as they want of their pet, and other users can comment on them. We wanted to create a space for pet lovers to share as much as they want of their pets, and not be told they post too much of their pet.

## Installation

We installed express, express-handlebars, handlebars, mysql2, sequelize, dotenv, bcrypt, and express-session, connect-session-sequelize,

## Usage

We used express as our server, sequelize to dynamically control our mysql2 database. We used handlebars as our HTML template and express-handlebars to connect it. We tracked user session with express-session and connected it to our ORM with connect-session-sequelize. We used dotenv and bcrypt to secure our password and the users.
